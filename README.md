Fork this repository and pull request your solution.
You can open an issue at any time if you have any questions.

# Let's get started

Let's pretend we launched a "Movie Guide Service". 

Your first objective as an android developer is to help us to build a friendly app for easily and fastly movies discovery.

> Keep Calm, do as much as you can, but keep in mind that you have up to 7 days to complete the challenge.

## Development Requirements

### Which technologies can I use?
- Kotlin
- Java
- Kotlin Multiplatform
- Flutter
- Reactive Native

### Should my code be automated tested?
- No. But you will need do that at bornlogic. Try it.

## Step One
Use a wrapper for rest connection to the API (https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api). You can use an existed one or create your own.
You must connect and get movies data.

## Step Two
It's show time! Remember, build essencial components for each reusable part of your app, such us lists and detail infos.
Objectves:
 
 - display the cover image of a list of movies ordering by "latest" or "top rated" in a grid layout
 - click on each movie and open details (title, year, synopsis, cast, trailer and any other you liked)
 - Use "video player" for trailers in detail
 - Build a way to favorite some movies
 - It must be able to filter by favorited movies
 - All movies' data must be storage on device locally. It means that users can use the app offline after first access
 - Update local stored list of movies frequenty if online while connected to wifi-only

- Android room (https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/room)
- Retrofit (https://square.github.io/retrofit/)
- Android volley (https://developer.android.com/training/volley)
- Espresso (https://developer.android.com/training/testing/espresso/index.html)


## Which are the main aspects we'll be evaluating in your code:

- Clean Code
- How far can you go through the challenge
- Bug count
